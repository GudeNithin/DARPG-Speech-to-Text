Hello, I am Nisha speaking on behalf of the Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances. Am I talking with a rare delay? Tell me, a survey call has been conducted to know your satisfaction level regarding 58 in Assam on 13 October 2023. Want to know? The reply given to you by Direct Test Training is as of today i.e. 10th November 10th November 2023. Right now the download option is not coming, nor is the certificate being downloaded, it is in the check nor the check is telling yet. Download and you are not getting the download option then how are you satisfied or are you satisfied or not, the download is done, there is a lot of need, so now you are solving the problem by registering, complete education should be provided, it is okay other than that. Would like to give more feedback. Download it quickly. Thank you so much. Thank you for giving.
